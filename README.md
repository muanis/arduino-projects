My Arduino Projects:
*Arduino Radar (Sonar)
This is one of my most popular project and it’s really fun to build. The radar can detect objects in front of it and map them on PC screen using the Processing IDE.

*Range Measurer and Digital Spirit Level
Here’s another project utilizing the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. This time we will use it to make an distance meter which can measure distances up to 4 meters, as well as, measure square area.

*Arduino Robot Arm
When it comes to automated manufacturing, robot arms play big role with so many applications. They are often used for welding, assembling, packing, painting, pick and place tasks and much more. This Arduino project is actually a robotic arm made out of 3D printed parts, servo motors joints and controlled using an Arduino Nano. What’s even cooler we can control the robot arm wirelessly via a smartphone and a custom build Android application.


*Arduino CNC Foam Cutting Machine
Building your own CNC machine might seem like a big challenge for many of you, but the following Arduino CNC Machine project shows that building a CNC machine is actually not that hard.


*Arduino Color Sorter
Sorting out objects or products by their color has an important real world application. These types of machines are often used for sorting fruits, seeds, plastics etc. The working concept of these machines is rather simple. All you need is a color detecting sensor and of course a system that feeds the object to the sensor and then sort it out.


*DIY Arduino Gimbal / Self-Stabilizing Platform
The following Arduino project is a simple gimbal or a self-stabilizing platform which can be used for keeping objects or the top platform level. The project is rather simple with just several electronic components.


*Arduino RC Airplane
Anyone who had a chance of playing around with some RC airplanes knows how cool and fun it is. It’s even cooler and more satisfying if you build the RC airplane on your own. The following project steps the satisfaction up even further, because here I will show you how to build your own RC airplane which is 100% DIY build. Also, we have a 100% DIY radio control system based on the Arduino.


*Arduino Robot Car
The combination of DC motors and Arduino is always fun, and so is this project. Here we will build our own robot car from scratch. The car will be powered with Li-ion batteries and two 12V DC motors, and controlled using the L298N driver and an analog Joystick.
